                    This project involves creating a text classification pipeline using a pre-trained BERT-based model (unitary/toxic-bert), specifically designed to identify toxic or harmful language in text. The classifier uses the TensorFlow framework to assess whether a given piece of text is considered toxic or not, based on a predefined threshold score. If the score is below the threshold (0.02), the text is classified as "Not Toxic," and if it exceeds the threshold, it is classified as "Toxic." The functionality is encapsulated in the is_toxic function, making it easy to integrate into various applications that need to analyze the sentiment or appropriateness of textual content.
